# Tic-Tac-Toe in Java

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. It allows two players to play the game in the command line by taking turns entering the row and column where they want to place their mark. The game ends when one of the players wins or when the grid is full and no more moves can be made. The game checks for winning combinations in rows, columns, and diagonals and declares the winner or a tie accordingly.

## Features
- Command-line interface for easy gameplay.
- Two-player mode (human vs. human).
- Automatic checking of win conditions.
- Handles invalid moves and prompts users accordingly.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system. You can check by running:
   ```sh
   java -version
   ```
   If Java is not installed, download and install it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

2. Clone this repository or download the source code:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/JAVA-TicTacToe.git
   cd JAVA-TicTacToe
   ```

3. Compile the Java source file:
   ```sh
   javac TicTacToe.java
   ```

4. Run the game:
   ```sh
   java TicTacToe
   ```

## How to Play
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns entering the row and column number where they want to place their mark (`X` or `O`).
- The game ends when a player wins or if all spots are filled, resulting in a tie.
- The program announces the result at the end.
